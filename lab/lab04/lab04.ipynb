    "For operations like arithmetic, or the functions in the NumPy library, you don't need to use `apply`, because they automatically work on each element of an array.  But there are many things that don't.  The string manipulation we did in today's lab is one example.  Since you can write any code you want in a function, `apply` gives you greater control over how you operate on data."

For CEOs with no previous year on record, it instead says \"(No previous year)\".  The values in this column are *strings*, not numbers, so like the `Total Pay` column, it's not usable without a bit of extra work.\n",

    "Given your current pay and the percentage increase from the previous year, you can compute your previous year's pay.  For example, if your pay is $\\$120$ this year, and that's an increase of 50% from the previous year, then your previous year's pay was $\\frac{\\$120}{1 + \\frac{50}{100}}$, or \\$80.\n",

Your GSI will be sending out a form to match you up with a partner for this project. You may also indicate if you're working alone or have already found a partner and do not need to be paired up. This form is **mandatory** - please fill it out before submitting your lab. Set `submitted` to `True` once you've submitted the form.\n",

You can use this [edThread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/52859/discussion/4275407) to find a partner if you want one. If you wish to work alone, no further action is required. Please set `submitted` to `True` to get credit for this problem.\n",
