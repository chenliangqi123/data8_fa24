    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",

    "    3\n",

    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",

In this case, `2` and `5` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
